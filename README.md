## Introduction

Our goal is to enable developers to create trusted data exchange systems on top of Casper Network. We're simplifying development of digital identity and digital authenticated documents for any external developer. The resulting solution must provide tools for developers to generate and manage digital identities (DIDs) and documents (VCs). The solution contains:

* off-chain backend logic
* smart contracts on Casper Network
* documentation
* _frontend demo applications (WIP)_
* _Verifiable Credentials SDK (WIP)_

The solution is publicly available on GitHub under MIT license.

## **Customer types**

### **Developers**

Software engineers will be using smart contracts, SDK and documentation to build applications for end customers (identity holder, verifiable credentials issuers and verifiers). Developers are looking to bootstrap their development effort by utilizing the SDK. Developers need to have clear, simple and easy to follow documentation and code samples.

### **Business Customers**

Business customers wonâ€™t be using SDK directly. Their goal is to understand how SSI technology works and what are its potential applications. Business customers will be looking at demo applications to understand use cases for the decentralized digital identity and verifiable credentials.
